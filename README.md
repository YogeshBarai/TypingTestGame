# TypingTestGame
TypingTestGame is a Python based program that gives you your typing speed. Sentences are displayed randomly based on the internal database of around 6000 different sentences. Its a very basic attempt at creating te application using pygames library.

Please note: The game is currently available ony on the TestPyPI platform. I plan to migrate it to the PyPi platform later on.
